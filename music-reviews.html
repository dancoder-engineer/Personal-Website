                <p>Tom Petty’s 1991 album concluded with the track Built to Last, about a love that would last forever. It was very easy to interpret this as being to his wife, especially for me, having misheard the chorus as “We were built to last, Tom and J??? forever.” As it turns out, his wife’s name was Jane. I could hear a distinct o sound in the unknown J word, but Jane is one syllable, and I’ve misheard lyrics before, so it fit (the actual lyric, for those wondering, was “We were built to last, on until forever.) Unfortunately, as they say, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.</p>
                <p>By 1994, his marriage was on the rocks. They weren’t divorced yet, but they were definitely getting there. This fact is bleedingly obvious if you listen to pretty much any track from this album. Sounds like a depressing time that might be ok but you really have to be in the mood for, right? Actually, it might just be the best album from the golden age of a music legend.</p>
                <p>The album starts off with the title track, and while it doesn’t seem to make lists of best album openers, this one belongs near the top of all of them. It’s also tied with Supper’s Ready for my favorite song of all time. Over some beautiful guitar and piano is a really touching lyric about being free of conflict and finding peace. If these themes resonate at all with you, maybe don’t listen to this one in public, because it’ll have you bawling.</p>
                <p>Most of the rest of the songs follow the theme of his marriage ending, running the full gamut of the roller coaster of emotion Petty must’ve been feeling. You Don’t Know How it Feels and Hard on Me about the anger he feels about his wife’s lack of empathy toward him. are The latter being a song that anyone who’s ever had a serious fight with their significant other will be able to relate to. Only a Broken Heart is filled with regret that he can’t have another chance to start over and do things right, with copious amounts of sadness, and To Find a Friend laments the difficulty of finding someone you can truly connect with.</p>
                <p>The album also has a few rock tracks that don’t necessarily fit into the album’s larger theme, but serve as some sorely needed relief from the heavy themes of the rest of the album. Those are Cabin Down Below andHoneybee, which Petty played on SNL with Nirvana’s Dave Grohl on drums. This appearance won Grohl an invitation to be Petty’s permanent drummer, but Grohl opted to start Foo Fighters instead.</p>
                <p>The album concludes with Wake Up Time, where Petty finally resigns himself to his fate, and reassures himself that “you’ll be alright, it’s just gonna take time.” That acceptance is the final stage of grief, and ending the album on that note is nothing short of a perfect ending to the journey this album takes its listener on.</p>
                <p>Wildflowers is a truly great experience. The shift away from Jeff Lynne’s production may be jarring for anyone who knows Petty from his work on Full Moon Fever, but once you get over that (and concentrate on the lyrics thorough multiple listens,) the album proves itself as Petty’s best.</p>

            <h2>John Cougar Mellencamp</h2>
            <h3>Scarecrow</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="reviewMain">
              <br>
              <p>In 1985, John Mellencamp’s music was outgrowing his John Cougar persona. Sure, he had tried to be socially conscious with his music before (such has how Jack & Diane was about an interracial couple before the record company put the kibosh on that lyric,) but his lyrics were generally not too out of the ordinary for pop music. On Scarecrow, he sought to change that with a concept album that tells the stories of Midwesterners during the Reagan era.</p>
              <p>The album opens with Rain on the Scarecrow, a fantastic rock track which tells the tale of his family losing their farm because they’re unable to pay a bank loan. Right away, the album’s themes start to come into focus, because this album isn’t just one or many stories about the Midwest, it’s a detailed look at the people. The album excels at showing us what makes these people tick, what’s important to them, and what threats they’re facing. Rain on the Scarecrow sets this up immediately by showing us that the narrator cherishes his family, and is a deeply religious man, even going so far as to pray for the soul of the auctioneer sent to auction off the farm.</p>
              <p>Minutes to Memories is another standout track, with the narrator as a young man, and vicariously, the listener, getting something of a lecture on the values of honesty and again, family, held dear by the Midwestern working class. The song’s story even has a cool twist at the end. Coupled with Grandma’s Theme, we can even see the album encouraging a respect for the elderly.</p>
              <p>Justice and Independence ’85 is a metaphor for how the nation has lost its way from the values of Justice and Independence that it was built on in the name of the military industrial complex. This fits into the album theme by showing how the Midwest is a patriotic place. It’s been said that true patriotism is love for one’s country and not necessarily the government, and this song gets at that theme, though indirectly.</p>
              <p>Songs like Rumbleseat and Between a Laugh and a Tear focus on how people handle hard times in their lives. While they can be seen as dealing with the hard times described in Rain on the Scarecrow, they’re general enough that the listener can easily put themselves into the songs.</p>
              <p>The next song is You Got to Stand for Somethin’, which would honestly serve as a great album closer. It’s one last look at the Midwestern values that make up the album’s emotional heart.</p>
             <p>The actual album closer is R.O.C.K in the U.S.A., which pays off a different theme of the album. Mellencamp was going for a 60s rock sound on this album, and prepared his band for it by rehearsing many songs of the 60s (if any such recordings still exist, this might make for a cool box set,) and this song pays lyrical homage to what the album has been paying musical homage to all this time, going on about all Mellencamp’s favorite bands that influenced his work, and inspired him to become the artist he did.</p>
              <p>The LP release ends there, but on CD and cassette, the album concludes with The Kind of Fella I Am, about sort of a tough young man falling in love with a young woman. Unfortunately, this song can come off as a little barbaric. When he says “I’m a jealous kind of fellow, and I might fall in love with you,” it comes off as a more than a little chauvinistic, as if he’s saying the object of his affections is just that – an object, and one owned by him at that. After an entire album making us care about the Midwestern people, this song can easily take away some of the personal investment the listener has been building up, and probably should’ve been relegated to a B side.</p>
              <p>A truly good story can take you someplace, and leave you feeling like you know its people and culture. While Scarecrow isn’t a rock opera, or even just one story, the album accomplishes this goal at least as well as some stories I’ve seen go on for ten times its runtime.</p>
