    <p class="teachingWords">Dan started his teaching journey at Nassau Community College, tutoring some of his friends in Japanese during free time in the school newspaper office. While he was going to school for medical coding at the time, he loved teaching so much that he decided to go for his MA in Teaching English as a Second Language at Hunter College.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="teachingWords">While at Hunter, Dan got involved with the Japanese department when he had to take a language class (he had already studied Japanese on his own for quite a few years at the time,) and soon became a teaching assistant and tutor in said department.</p>

    <p class="teachingWords">Soon enough, it came time to do student teaching. While the video here was taken at Hunter College, Dan did his student teaching at Laguartdia Community College in Queens, NY, where he assisted in the teaching of a class to incoming college students from all over the world learning the basics of Academic English through the content of the American civil rights movement. Perhaps Dan's most treasured memory of this class is teaching the class about Jackie Robinson, and then taking them to the movie theater to see the movie 42.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="teachingWords">After finishing up his MA, Dan then moved to China and taught English for six years at Web International English. In this job, Dan taught students of all ages, from first graders to senior citizens! This job allowed him to have fun, both on the job, and outside of work exploring and experiencing the foreign country that served as his home all that time.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="teachingWords">Perhaps Dan's most popular line of classes was his music English Corners. During these classes, students got a culture lesson and were exposed to some fantastic music, as well as the usual English class words and grammar.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="teachingWords">In this English Corner, Dan made a short movie with his students. The students had a lot of fun, and learned plenty of new words and phrases they wouldn't have otherwise known.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="teachingWords">When Dan came home from China, COVID hit, so he was unable to find a job in the field. He did Uber Eats for a while before deciding to learn coding, for a different career that he would enjoy no less than teaching, but is also pandemic proof!</p>
