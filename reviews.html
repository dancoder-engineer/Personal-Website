                <p>Tom Petty’s 1991 album concluded with the track “Built to Last,” about a love that would last forever. It was very easy to interpret this as being to his wife, especially for me, having misheard the chorus as “We were built to last, Tom and J??? forever.” As it turns out, his wife’s name was Jane. I could hear a distinct o sound in the unknown J word, but Jane is one syllable, and I’ve misheard lyrics before, so it fit (the actual lyric, for those wondering, was “We were built to last, on until forever.) Unfortunately, as they say, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.</p>
                <p>By 1994, his marriage was on the rocks. They weren’t divorced yet, but they were definitely getting there. This fact is bleedingly obvious if you listen to pretty much any track from this album. Sounds like a depressing time that might be ok but you really have to be in the mood for, right? Actually, it might just be the best album from the golden age of a music legend.</p>
                <p>The album starts off with the title track, and while it doesn’t seem to make lists of best album openers, this one belongs near the top of all of them. It’s also tied with Supper’s Ready for my favorite song of all time. Over some beautiful guitar and piano is a really touching lyric about being free of conflict and finding peace. If these themes resonate at all with you, maybe don’t listen to this one in public, because it’ll have you bawling.</p>
                <p>Most of the rest of the songs follow the theme of his marriage ending, running the full gamut of the roller coaster of emotion Petty must’ve been feeling. You Don’t Know How it Feels and Hard on Me about the anger he feels about his wife’s lack of empathy toward him. are The latter being a song that anyone who’s ever had a serious fight with their significant other will be able to relate to. Only a Broken Heart is filled with regret that he can’t have another chance to start over and do things right, with copious amounts of sadness, and To Find a Friend laments the difficulty of finding someone you can truly connect with.</p>
                <p>The album also has a few rock tracks that don’t necessarily fit into the album’s larger theme, but serve as some sorely needed relief from the heavy themes of the rest of the album. Those are Cabin Down Below andHoneybee, which Petty played on SNL with Nirvana’s Dave Grohl on drums. This appearance won Grohl an invitation to be Petty’s permanent drummer, but Grohl opted to start Foo Fighters instead.</p>
                <p>The album concludes with Wake Up Time, where Petty finally resigns himself to his fate, and reassures himself that “you’ll be alright, it’s just gonna take time.” That acceptance is the final stage of grief, and ending the album on that note is nothing short of a perfect ending to the journey this album takes its listener on.</p>
                <p>Wildflowers is a truly great experience. The shift away from Jeff Lynne’s production may be jarring for anyone who knows Petty from his work on Full Moon Fever, but once you get over that (and concentrate on the lyrics thorough multiple listens,) the album proves itself as Petty’s best.</p>
