                  <br>
                  <p>The Final Fantasy series has long been a cash cow series for Square-Enix. From the early days, to its golden age, to its serious decline in quality over the past twenty years, the sales have always been high. Lately, however, there’s been a problem. You see, games take much longer to make these days, and one game every five years makes far less money than one gave every two or three years. They could remake the earlier games, but they’ve already done that… Wait, remake them? Yeah, they can do that… Again.</p>
                  <p>Square’s remakes of their older games have been some of the highlights in the gaming world these past few years. We finally got Trials of Mana in America, as well as a cool remake. The SaGa frontier remake finishes the game, and adds some features I can’t believe they left out of the original game (running from battles!) They recently remade Legend of Mana with gorgeous graphics and a redone soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura, and now they’ve also remade the first three Final Fantasy games with similarly high quality.</p>
                  <p>The best part about these remakes is the new soundtracks. Supervised (not arranged) by series composer Nobuo Uematsu, almost every song is perfect. They seem to have built upon the remixes done for the PlayStation versions of these games, but played with real instruments. Some of the highlights are the world map theme, the battle theme, and Mount Gulg (aka the Gurgu Volcano for my fellow old geezers.)</p>
                  <p>The soundtracks are not the only good new features, however. There are no more ineffective attacks, with characters simply moving onto the next enemy if the one they’re attacking is dead. Grinding is much faster, making the game a far more briskly paced experience than it’s ever been. I finished in a bit over twelve hours, and I’ve seen people on the internet do it much faster than that. The quick save feature is really nice, too. It allows you to save anywhere. The save doesn’t erase when you load it, but there’s only one quick save slot, so you still need to be careful and make backup saves when you’re able. This feature comes in extra handy in Final Fantasy 3’s infamous endgame, but that’s neither here nor there since we’re talking about the first game in this review.</p>
                  <p>There is also unlimited space for equipment and items, streamlining the process of buying and equipping new gear. They’ve also added ethers to restore MP and Phoenix Downs to revive fallen comrades. Purists may not like these new features (some, but not all of which come directly from previous remakes,) but as I get older, I don’t have six months to sit in front of my TV and play Final Fantasy 1, so a quicker experience is definitely appreciated.</p>
                  <p>Purists will, however, enjoy the return to MP charges for every individual level of magic, going back to the way the original game did things, rather than having a set number of MP that you can use to cast any magic spell.</p>
                  <p>Here are only a few issues. The stat increases on level up are still completely random, which can lead to one or more characters falling completely behind (my black mage.) Also, in battle when you enter the wrong command with one character, rather than having a button right there on the screen to go back, you have to click right to a different menu, where you can press the word “back” to go back.
                  <p>Also, there’s a feature where you can simply touch where you want your character to move on the map, and they’ll move there automatically, which I really enjoy because if I’m putting my phone down on a desk, it’s much easier to control that way, but that feature doesn’t work in airships. I really hope that oversight is fixed in future Pixel Remasters.</p>
                  <p>The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster brings this game into a new age with gameplay that respects the player’s time and delivers a host of new features. Honestly, when I saw they were doing all of Final Fantasy 1-6 like this, with 1-3 all releasing at once, I thought I’d just get 3 and wait for 4-6 since the PSP remakes of 1 and 2 were already great, but these remakes are on a whole other level. If you’re waiting for them to come to console, then I hope they do, but you honestly can’t go wrong with the versions that are out (I played the Android version on a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.) Buy them now, or wait for a version on your preferred platform, but don’t skip these remasters.</p>

                <br><h2>Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="gameReviewMain">
                  <br>
                  <p><strong>This review was written on the game's release in 2008. Time change, and this review will make you sad as a result. Better get some tissues for this one!</strong></p>
                  <p>In the gaming industry, there is a list of series that can be counted on for a new entry every year. Of course you have your yearly sport game roster updates, but then there are games that the developers put actual work into every year. These series include Tales of, Metal Gear Solid, and Castlevania. This past week, Konami released their yearly Castlevania game, Order of Ecclesia.</p>
                  <p>The first thing that stands out in Order of Ecclesia is that it's more story oriented than past games in the series. The game starts off with cut-scenes introducing Shanoa and Albus, two people working for the titular organization, Ecclesia. Their leader, Barlow wants Shanoa to absorb a glyph known as Dominus in order to defeat Dracula once and for all. Albus isn't very happy with this decision and takes Dominus for himself. Shanoa's memory gets wiped, and soon enough Barlow sends her to kill Albus and get Dominus back.</p>                  
                  <p>As the story progresses, Shanoa is charged with the task of rescuing all the citizens of a local village, who were imprisoned throughout the countryside. As she saves them all, they give Shanoa missions that she can complete in order to get materials for them to make her better equipment to sell at the local store. Similar missions were in earlier Castlevania installments, but there are more this time around, and the many sources of the missions make them more varied.</p>                  
                  <p>The problems with this game arise when you look at the gameplay. While it still manages to be a fun game, this game takes an awful long time getting to be fun. For the first three to four hours, the game is bad. If you buy this game, prepare to slog through some of the worst designed areas ever in a Castlevania game at the beginning. However, while first few areas may be crap, they are not an accurate representation of the rest of the game, so their real problem is that being at the beginning, people who won’t like to have to push through annoying parts of games may just shelve the game while missing out on any of the enjoyment the game has to offer.</p>                  
                  <p>Once you’re past the beginning, the game does get fun, but there are some problems. The most obvious problem is the game’s boss fights. Order of Ecclesia’s structure becomes something like this; go through a fun platforming section for ten minutes, spend twenty minutes dying at a boss, decide to do some missions from the townspeople, go online to find where the items are, spend a half hour getting the items in game, then spend another half hour trying to defeat the boss. Once that’s done, do it again and again for the rest of the game. Order of Ecclesia calls to mind the games of the eighties in this regard. Speedrunners today can beat most of those games in about fifteen to thirty minutes, so the developers had to find ways to artificially lengthen the games, usually through massive difficulty or (in the case of RPGs) level grinding. Since Order of Ecclesia has experience levels, it’s guilty on both of those counts.</p>                  
                  <p>As for music, another of Castlevania’s high points, Order of Ecclesia fails to deliver. After going through most of the game, I only remember two songs in the entire game, and judging the game by the standards of the series in which it resides, this is considered poor. One song I feel the need to address is one of the two I remember. About three quarters of the way through the game, you enter a castle. Going in, you expect something resembling a Castlevania first section of the castle music, but instead it sounds more like a first section of the castle music from a Mega Man game. The song is great, but it doesn’t fit in a Castlevania game.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the day, Order of Ecclesia is a disappointing entry in the Castlevania series. They tried something different with all the varied areas, but as a result, they didn’t take the time and make the areas big enough or the game long enough, so the developers had to resort to artificial lengthening. Because of this, the game feels sloppy and seems like a wasted opportunity for the series. Maybe 2009’s Castlevania game will capitalize on everything Ecclesia tried to bring to the series and be a masterpiece, but for the time being, Ecclesia is best left to the Castlevania fans who want to play every game in the series.</p>

            <br><h2>Star Ocean: First Departure</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="gameReviewMain">
             <br>
             <p>1996 is when the 32 bit console generation kicked into high gear. Final Fantasy VII had been announced, Super Mario 64 was released, and great RPG after great RPG was being released for Saturn (most of which came out in Japan only.) However, even after most people, including Nintendo’s American branch had considered the Super NES a dead system, it still had a couple of great games on the horizon. One was Rockman and Forte, which originally came out on Super Famicom (the Japanese name for the Super NES) in 1998. That game was remade for Game Boy Advance in 2003 and came out in America as Megaman and Bass. The other game came out for Super Famicom in July of 1996. That game was Star Ocean.</p>
             <p>Star Ocean was a groundbreaking game, especially for being in cartridge format. It contained voice acting for the introduction, and characters actually spoke in battle, reacting to what was going on. The music was extremely high quality, challenging anything the fledgling CD consoles had done without streamed audio at the time, and the graphics were nothing short of amazing. Now Star Ocean has been remade for PSP, and it is being released in America for the first time.</p>
             <p>When you play Star Ocean, the first thing you’ll probably notice is that it borrows a lot from Star Trek. You’ll see crew members of a spaceship beam down to the planet. That ship is a member of an obvious counterpart to Star Trek’s Federation, and in order to go back in time the characters go through the Guardian of Forever, operating under an alias.</p>
             <p>The story centers around Roddick and Millie, a couple of teenagers from a planet called Roak, which is still in the medieval stage of development. One day, people on the planet start turning to stone because of an unknown virus. When Millie’s father is turned to stone, Roddick and their friend Dorne set out to search for an herb which can supposedly cure the disease. Along the way, Dorne also contracts the virus. Soon after, Ronix and Ilia, of the Starship Calnus beam down to Roak, unintentionally exposing themselves to the three main characters. As it turns out, Roak is being used as a guinea pig for a biological weapon being developed by an evil space empire, and the only way to develop a cure is to go back in time. Roddick and Millie agree to go back in time to help find out more about the disease.</p>
             <p>The gameplay was novel for its time, but all its advancements have been done many times since, and therefore will not have the same effect on anyone who didn’t play it when it first came out in 1996. Despite this, the game is still very fun to play. Star Ocean, like any RPG has its share of towns and dungeons, but adds much to the formula. One addition is Private Actions. When you go to a town, you have the option of splitting your party up. When this happens, you’ll only control Roddick, having the ability to walk around and talk to the rest of your party members. The Private Actions add a lot of character development to the experience.</p>
             <p>The battle system is action based, with the player controlling one character while the rest of the party fights by themselves. You can give orders to the party members not under your direct control, but there’s not much to the battle system. The main reason for that is the fact that almost all battles can be won simply by button mashing. Any battle that can’t be on by button mashing can be won by leveling up and then button mashing. There’s also a fairly deep skill system, where skill points, earned on level up, can be used to purchase stat increases, the ability to better make use of the game’s deep item creation system, or new moves in battle.</p>
             <p>Where the battle system falters is in the fact its type of battle system has been refined and improved upon to a major degree since Star Ocean: The Second Story (which this game draws the battle system from.) The inability to block attacks is annoying, and the fact that using magic stops the battle for spell animations seems very cumbersome, and both of these issues make the game seem somewhat dated.</p>
             <p>As for that item creation system, it’s very much a mixed bag. While it can be fun, there are a very small number of ultimate items that can be made only through that system. Nowhere in the game does it tell you the formulas, and some of the items used to make the better weapons and armor are either very expensive, or one of a kind, meaning its possible to use them up and make it so that you permeant lose the item you want to make. You can also fail at creating items, and if you fail, you lose the materials.</p>
             <p>The music is the part of this game that has aged most gracefully. All the songs have been arranged to better make use of the new hardware, and it sounds great. True, the music quality isn’t as impressive as the original’s was in 1996, but the soundtrack remains one of Motoi Sakuraba’s finest, even without the technical impressiveness behind it.</p>
             <p>The graphics, while not nearly as good as some recent graphical powerhouses for PSP, still manage to look beautiful. The graphics were clearly designed to fit in with Star Ocean: The Second Story, which was released in 1999, and will be released on PSP this coming January. When the background are realtime 3d, rather than prerenders (which all look lovely,) the game can look somewhat dated, but they never sink to the level of being bad, or detracting from the gameplay.</p>
             <p>Star Ocean: First Departure is a PSP game not to be missed. As a remake, it will not be as popular as Chrono Trigger for DS will be, but that can mainly be attributed to the fact that the original Star Ocean never saw a US release. Had that game been released in America, this would be one of the most eagerly awaited games of this year. As it stands however, First Departure is a great way to get your hands on one of the 16-bit era’s final masterpieces.</p>
